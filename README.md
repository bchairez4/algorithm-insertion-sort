# algorithm-insertion-sort

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the selection sort algorithm.
The input is a std::vector of elements, that are of a comparative type, acting as an array and the output is the sorted array. 

Insertion sort is an in-place algorithm that works by iteratively taking an element from the input array, locating where it belongs in relative comparison to the other elements, and placing it in it's sorted position while shifting other elements over if needed. The process ends when all elements have been sorted.
