# algorithm-insertion-sort

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the selection sort algorithm using C++. 
The input is an array of items that are of a comparative type and the output is the sorted array. 
The way insertion sort works is by removing one element from the input array, finds the location it belongs, and places it there.

Insertion sorts are done in place and iterate up the array leaving behind the sorted array.
